From the need of quiet space required for study, the Board has leased the municipal classrooms since 1957 and made the study room available to the students of Girangaon. However, due to the changing school policies of the municipality, it has been difficult for the students to get classes in the departmental municipal schools. At present, the Organization has only one full time independent study room  in the Chinchpokali division. In view of the number of students in central Mumbai, our first priority project is to set up an equine study in all four other departments of the Board.
